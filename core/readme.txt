Shotgun frenzy Plus (a.k.a "sf14unofficialpatchv8g.pk3") Is the same good old mod.
Except it contains a lot of stuff more inside.

What is inside?
	===) Some more balances to the marine side.
	===) Drones are back, and with more!
	===) Kinda Clean code. (Lot'sa refactoring)
	===) The under-used guns are updated for more variety for selection!
	===) A Terminal that supports mouse movement! And it's easier to mantain!
	===) Customizable parematers with the sf+ settings!
	===) Lotta Fixes from the original!
	===) Mechanical Upgrades! In the right way.
	===) Player Upgrades on the Health terminal!
	===) Drop monies to the players!
	===) New turrets like the Shotgun Turret are here!
	===) An improved commander terminal, keeping their good old looks!
	===) Slain more demons with a (kind-of) updated monster rooster!
	===) Kill-Streaks are here! Break milestones and earn extra U.Ps!

	No seriously, read this for the love of hell.
	
	*) I'm NOT, the owner of Shotgun Frenzy, that credit goes to Wad'a'Holic.
	
	*) I have no permission to edit Shotgun Frenzy directly, yet taking the 
	same action as T3h Player, I made this, as a paralel version of the same 
	mod.
	
	*) This mod uses as base the latest relase of Shotun Frenzy. Version: 14.
	
	*) This mod is based on the series of patchs made by t3h player. So thank 
	him also for making this mod a reality.
	
	*) This is NOT an offical relase for Shotgun Frenzy.
	
	*) YES. This thing uses a lot of stuff taken from Realm667, You got a 
	problem with that? I mean, I know you'd hate to see the same resources seen
	in each mod of doom, but for me, in this mod, they're the spot-light to this
	wonderful tribute of Shotgun Frenzy. Also, I'm too lazy to do each weapon from 
	scratch.
	
	*) You're allowed to make mods based on this. Just don't modify this and 
	do a different patch.
	
	*) You're allowed to take code from here, with one condition: Say thanks to 
	Shotgun Frenzy, SF Plus, and to the other sources where they might been 
	taken.
	
	*) You're allowed to take some of the media contained in sfplus_res_v.x 
	files, with one condition: Say thanks to Shotgun Frenzy, SF Plus,
	and to the other sources where they might been taken.
	
	*) ACS-Utils, ACS-Rects and the Samu-Terminal are used in this mod. All of
	them free to use for everyone. (The credits are not needed, but i'll give 
	you an arepa if you do it anyway :3)
	
	*) You're allowed to spread this to the world. With no profitable pruposes.
	(Come on, all of the wads out there are free to make for everyone, why you 
	would do that? If you need money so badly, then get a job. Hippe.)
	
	*) Last, but not least, if you found bugs, go to the zandronum forum 
	(coming soon) and to Samu's Chambers. (A discord server where i update this 
	thing and other doomy stuffs.)
