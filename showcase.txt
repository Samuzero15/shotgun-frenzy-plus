Fixed a glitch which let's you create turrets, but without checking the credits.
Now the commander should check the terrain, if the spawning of a turret or dispenser is being blocked, or placed in liquids (wip) the spawning will fail, but the team credits will be refunded.
Hidden some spamming on the server log console.
The turrets shall now delete themselves with the base included.
Now the kill-streak flow will not be interrupted by the building of a deployable item.
Spawnshield should work again (needs some testing though)
Pressing F12 (Coop Spy) will force you to look at the commander screen.
Small fix on the sf_doorholdtime cvar.
Removed the useless rune sync from the player upgrades. But this is'nt the last time you see it.
Rewritten the CMD event handling system, and optimized the cmd terminal.
Turret Rail in the ammo terminal should be given after pursache once again.
Prosesing phase 1 and 2 can boost up the enemy bounty for the players and commander together!
Enemies killed with cripple pulse will not grant credits to the player. (However, the commander can gain credits for that)
Auto-Researching's Script has been revamped too, now notifying the players the new researchs on CF and SD maps! (Also, stimpacks and adrenaline can be given with this revamp.)
A new Mech Upgrade! Efficiency: Reduces the time on the repairings, rocket reloading and autorepair intervals.
Mech Rocket Upgrade price rises to 5500.
Slowed a bit the rocket reloading time for the Mech. You can restore it with the efficiency upgrade.
Returning the mech back to the base will have a delay penalty depending on the health. Just to discourage the insta-healing of the mechs.
The mech is a bit more faster in the base level, but it's upgrades does less effect, maxing it up will make the tank run like a normal marine.
Stimpacks now they heal 20 hp!
Other smoll fixes.
