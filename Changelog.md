	// Comments
	!) Pretty important stuff.

## v1 - The path of the damned...

#### (24 / 9 / 2024) [Combat boomstick now works with grenades and fist]
	*) What says in the title, still WIP

#### (22 / 9 / 2024) [Fisting, Grenade Throwing and new keys]
	+) (For the base Beretta and base Boomstick) Now these weapons can be able to throw grenades and fist up foes!
	*) Now using idkfa or idfa will give the normal backpack ammo capacity and will not be overriden by the ammo pad.
	+) Added some hand sprites for throwing and punching.
	*) Fixed the Soul Rune pickup sprite.
	*) De-harcoded the stay time of the pickups spawned by the supplier.

#### (15 / 9 / 2024) [Weapon Quick-Switch on the works]
	*) Renamed all the weapon decorate files with the .dec extension, just for easier readability with visual studio code.
	+) Added a new Decorate file, "frenzy_weapon.dec". Which it holds all the weapons that exists in the game.
	*) Generalized the boomstick and beretta into the frenzy_weapon actor, now these guns can quick-switch between them!
	// Fire when raising a weapon to instantly fire, no need to wait for the raising animation to work.
	// To be implemented in the rest of weapons.

#### (14 / 9 / 2024) [Spitters shootable grenades, Patcher's Move and Recycle modes & Sprite Repleacements]
	// 'Sup! how is it going?
	// Yeah I got no excuse for not doing any progress since like 10 months with no activity on the repository.
	// I'm finally graduated as a Informatics Engineer. And i've been goofing arround with some of my closest friends. Not to mention also the tense situation of my country (yes, i'm venezuelan, the electoral fraud really pissed us all), and also my lack of motivation to continue doing some updates on SF+, but you know what? Screw it. I'll keep doing what I love to do. Doing some more shotgun frenzy stuff :D.
	// So, what did i done this time?
	!*) Some sprite replacements on the Spitter and the Beretta + Variants, specially adding those black cool gloves to the weapons.
	!*) Now the base spitter gun will have an attached grenade launcher, with 5 grenades as base ammuniton.
	*) The animation after launching a grenade with the spitter can be cancelled with the primary fire.
	*) The grenades thrown by spitters can be shot for a greater radius AoD.
	!+) The patcher now can do some extra functions, move, and recycle turrets and dispensers!
	// Switch between modes with the Reload key. Yeah, sounds ridiculous, the reload key used ONLY for the Patcher. However, I MIGHT give it some other uses with other weapons.
	// Move mode can move turrets and dispensers, aim to a building and fire with the alt-fire, hold the altfire to the place where you want to move your turret, the release the trigger and voalÃ¡!, your building is teleported from spot A to spot B. The price depends on how far you're planning to move your building.
	// Sell mode can dismount buildings for some extra coins. Aim to a building and fire with the alt-fire, release the trigger to sell the building. The price depends on how advanced and how expensive is the upgrade price.
	*) Cleanup and optimization on the lumpread.acs file.
	*) Now the terminals will not open until the game has started.
	// Also added a new branch, the dev branch. Just to play arround with branch developing.

#### (11 / 11 / 2023) [New custom Lumps, monster waves, and improvements]
	// 4 weeks with no commits?! Shiet. Let's fix that.
	*) Updated Pack-o-daemon
	*) Sprite re-organization on the resources part, specally adding folders on each monster sprite.
	*) Some new sprites for both SSGs. Courtesy of Sonik.k.o (ThatSonicFan).
	+) A new monster wave is being added! The Aerial wave!
	// Airbone monsters will come to attack from the sky! Let's hope you dont have Quiroptophobia, because Bats will be the first of your problems, not for their health, but actually for the sheer numbers.
	+) Speaking of bats, added Giant Bats, a bad (skulled bat), and re-added the bat familiar.
	!+) To celebrate the addition of the SCORINFO lump, the scoreboard is now modified for showing the credits, upgrade points, kills, kill-streaks, deaths and of course the players in the game!
	!+) Now the Item Hud is now customizable! Change the position, alpha (transpaency), and the orientation of the item bar! On SF+ Settings > User Options.
	*) Reworked the lump reading scripts, shorter and straight to the point.
	!+) Added the SFRUNDEF, SFMWAVES and SFITMDEF lumps, also refactored the SFWEPDEF lump for easier addition and readability!
	// SFRUNDEF defines the runes, SFITMDEF defines the items, SFMWAVES defines the monster waves! Cool additions for the modders to play around!
	!*) The Autosave feature has been reworked and now it's lagless, and smart! (although, again, needs some testing)
	+) Now monster's stamina (in decorate), will hardcode the class which a monster belongs to.
	+) Also the monster's accuracy (in decorate), will tell if the monster can be championized (-1=no, 0=yes, 1=always).
	*) Some small fixes on the Samu Terminal

#### (6 / 6 - 18 / 7 / 2023) [New SFWEPDEF Lump, Inputs on terminals]
	// Heyo! another month of developing with some other changes!
	*) Splitted the 3 terminal main functions (Draw, Input and Update) into 3 scripts for more processing. (and fool out the runaway errors!)

	!*) Now buy weapon page is now revamped, including the new panels!
	!*) Now it is possible to add 50 packs per category, 3 weapons per pack, and 8 upgrades* per weapon through modding (and the new SFWEPDEF will help you with that!)
	// *The upgrade weapon page still needs some work to be actually useful with the new incoming 8 upgrades per weapon.
	!+) 3 wild SFWEPDEF lump file has appeared!
	// SFWEPDEF? da hell is that? you might ask. That lump is not supported by Zdoom, or Zandronum in general, uuuh what?
	// Well, since Zandronum 3.2 recent alpha (Look up Readme file for the link), I went full on experiment with some new TDRR functions for reading lumps.
	// Thanks to that, it is now possible to simplify and make it accesible for everyone in adding new mods on SF+.
	// You do not need to use ACS to recompile a script, now weapon addons are extremly easy to add! That's why SFWEPDEFs are there.
	// But more about that later~ I'll update the docs for it, I Promise.
	*) Fixed the cvar pricing for stimpacks, mechs and runes.

#### (4 - 5 / 6 / 2023) [SSG's reworks, Price Edit, Cvarified Prices]

#### (2 / 6 / 2023) 
	*) Well, ssg has been reworked. Now you can deal more damage on close shots.
	// Base SSG can create ricoshot bullets and explosive damage.

	// Explosive SSG can create a long standing fire in flesh hits (on demon hit) that stands for like 3-5 seconds.

	// About time to make a release! (although it's barely tested online, but should be stable enough, SHOULD)

#### (30 / 10 - 14 / 11 / 2022) [Stimpack upgrades!, fixes and champion drops (wip)]
	!+) Yes!, now the stimpacks are upgradeable! Get them on the Health terminal!
	-) Reduced the amount of stimpacks given by 5, but, you can go back to 10 with the stimpack upgrades.
	+) Added some extra items for the future item drops from champions (WIP)
	*) Some small rewrite on the teminal menus.
	*) Moved the patcher code to a separated file.

	*) Changed some sounds for armor/ammo pickups and added some feedback sounds for the patcher.
	+) Added some stimpack counter for the full screen.
	*) Modified the fullscreen player hud, now kill-streaks are visible! (inluding high, current and next milestone)

#### (16 - 24 / 10 / 2022) [Sprites for flame and rail turrets + BFG upgrade]
	*) Extra touchs on the turret code
	+) Extra sprites for the Rail Turret, Thanks MadCat!
	+) New sprite replacement for the flamer turret! (yes, i did frankedsprited this one, and im proud of it uwu)
	*) Some renames in the files.
	*) Updating the showcase list.
	*) Super BFG now becomes the Splash-Spread BFG, specially beacuse now this weapon spreads faster and does some extra damage.
	*) BFG and all the other bfgs gains an altfire, the beta's Doom BFG. (that flurry of plasmas 'member?)
	!+) A new upgrade for the BFG! The Overcharged BFG!
	// This big bastard fires a ball that hits 10 times. Exploding on each hit, and increasing it's damage and size. Also Seeks.
	// While it's by far the most expensive in ammo consumption (300 cells per shot), slow compared to the original bfg, and quite expensive in the terminal (6 UPs). This weapon works as a nice counterpart to it's splashy counsin. Making it effective for dealing a shietton of damage with a massive big ball. It's powerful enough to oneshot a Cyberdemon-Annihilator!
