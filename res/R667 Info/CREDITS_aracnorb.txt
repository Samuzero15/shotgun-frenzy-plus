Description: A floating oversized brain with a powerful continuous psionic stream attack. The stream of psi spirals
             erratically and homes in on its target, making it a chore to evade. Luckily, these guys aren't
			 terribly strong, and will go down in a single point-blank SSG shot, providing you can get up close
			 enough without it microwaving your brain, or mauling you to death with its teeth.
