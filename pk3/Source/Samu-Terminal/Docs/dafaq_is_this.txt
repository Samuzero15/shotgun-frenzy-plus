This is a GUI Framework Library!

The 
Systemic 
Advanced
Multiplayer
User
Terminal

Or Samu-Terminal for short :v

This thing holds some objetives.

-) Easy to implement!: For the ACS Coder who wants to 
build moused terminals or GUI interfaces anytime, anywhere!.

-) No need to brainstorm!: Why re-invent the wheel when 
you ride a car already? This is a Framework! You got the tools
to make your thing, so why the hell you want to start from 
scratch when you have this?

-) Multiplayer Support!: Moused GUIs in multiplayer are sacred 
 things in the zandronum community, the only chance to see this
 was in Idiotic LMS. Hopefully, lets wait for more people to get
 the guts to implement this beauty. Also, the badwidth consuming
 for the server is almost null! all thanks for the Clientside 
 running loop!
 
-) The simpler, the better!: Making components are simple and easy
 to do! Just grab a paper, sketch a gui, and make it true with the
 clear functions that this framework can offer to you!
 
-) Open sauce to your chilies!: Hosted on github, and ready to be commited
 this project can be modified by everyone!
 
-) Customizable!: Want to move the toast a bit?, No backgorund?, 
conflicting Hud IDS?, go customize it by yourself!

-) ACSUtils + ACSRects are here!: Even if you switch to the acs util compiler
you will find this useful to your project! Pretty recommended!
