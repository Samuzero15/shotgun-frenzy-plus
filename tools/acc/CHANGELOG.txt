zt-bcc 0.10.0 alpha 7:
* Fix broken ABI-compatibility when importing objects in namespaces from other libraries compiled with older BCC.
* Fix broken module heap allocation in libbcs.

Known bugs:
* #if preprocessor directive causes issues with character literal parsing. It's recommended to not use it for now (#ifdef and the rest work fine, however).
